# 📖 Map Readability Improvements

## Overview
The graph visualization has been significantly improved to make ALL city names clearly readable and visible.

---

## ✅ Improvements Made

### 1. **Larger Canvas Size**
- ❌ Before: 520px height
- ✅ After: **650px height** (+25% more space)
- **Result**: More vertical room for cities and labels

### 2. **Bigger, Bolder City Labels**
- ❌ Before: 13px font size, 3px stroke
- ✅ After: **14px font size, 4px white stroke**
- **Added**: Letter spacing (0.3px) for clarity
- **Result**: Much more readable labels

### 3. **Larger City Nodes**
- ❌ Before: 12px radius
- ✅ After: **13px radius** (default), up to 18px for start/end
- **Result**: More prominent city markers

### 4. **Better City Spacing**
Reorganized coordinates to prevent overlap:

**North Region** (more spread):
- Jammu, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Dehradun - better horizontal spacing

**UP/Bihar** (vertical spread):
- Agra, Lucknow, Varanasi, Patna - more vertical distance

**Gujarat** (diagonal arrangement):
- Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat - diagonal spread

**Maharashtra** (better distribution):
- Mumbai, Nashik, Pune, Nagpur - optimized positions

**South** (more room):
- Bangalore, Mysore, Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Kochi - better spacing

### 5. **Smart Label Positioning**
Implemented intelligent label placement:
- **Most labels**: Below the city node (default)
- **Crowded areas**: Labels placed ABOVE the node
- **Special cases**: Extra spacing for clarity

**Labels Above Node** (to avoid overlap):
- Gurgaon, Nashik, Rajkot, Vadodara, Ludhiana

**Extra Spacing Below**:
- Agra, Kanpur, Allahabad, Gaya

### 6. **Cleaner Route Display**
- Route labels still hidden by default (keeps map clean)
- Show on hover for exploration
- Always visible on selected routes
- Slightly larger font (11px) for route labels

## 📏 Spacing Improvements

### Minimum Distances Between Cities

| Region | Min Distance | Result |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| North (Jammu-Amritsar-Chandigarh) | 40-50px | No overlap |
| UP (Agra-Lucknow-Varanasi) | 45px vertical | Clear separation |
| Gujarat (Ahm-Rajkot-Surat) | 35-45px | Diagonal spread |
| Maharashtra | 40-50px | Well distributed |
| South (All cities) | 40-65px | Ample space |

## 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

### Text Readability
1. **White stroke** (4px) around all labels = Always readable
2. **Bold weight** (700) = Easy to see
3. **Larger font** (14px) = Clear from distance
4. **Letter spacing** = Less cramped

### Node Visibility
1. **Larger circles** (13px) = Easy to spot
2. **White borders** (4px) = Stand out from background
3. **Drop shadows** = Create depth
4. **Hover effect** = Grows to 15px

- Row 4: Delhi, Jaipur (y:135-155)
- ...continues down to...
- Bottom: Kochi, Madurai (y:475-480)

**West to East** (Left to Right):
- Column 1: Gujarat cities (x:135-175)
- Column 2: Maharashtra, Karnataka (x:190-265)
- Column 3: MP, Central (x:230-325)
- Column 4: UP, Bihar (x:300-410)

else {
    yOffset = 32; // Below node
}
```
