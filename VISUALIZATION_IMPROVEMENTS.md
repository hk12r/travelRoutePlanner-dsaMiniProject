# 🎨 Map Visualization Improvements

## Overview
The graph visualization has been significantly improved to reduce clutter and make routes clearer and easier to follow.

---

## ✨ Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Cleaner Edge/Route Lines**
- **Reduced opacity** of unselected routes (40% opacity)
- **Thinner default lines** (1.5px instead of 2px) to reduce visual clutter
- **Light gray color** (#d1d5db) for non-highlighted routes
- Routes now blend into background until needed

### 2. **Smart Label Display**
- **Distance labels hidden by default** - reduces text clutter significantly
- **Show on hover** - hover over any route to see its distance
- **Always visible for highlighted routes** - selected path shows all distances
- **Better label positioning** - perpendicular offset prevents overlapping
- **White outline on text** - makes labels readable on any background

### 3. **Enhanced Highlighted Routes**
- **Thicker highlighted lines** (6px) - much more visible
- **Bright green color** with shadow effect
- **100% opacity** - stands out clearly
- **Animated dashed pattern** - draws attention to the selected route
- **Highlighted labels** - bold and colorful for selected path

### 4. **Improved Node (City) Styling**
- **Larger nodes** (12px radius instead of 10px)
- **Thicker white borders** (4px) - better visibility
- **Drop shadow effect** - creates depth and separation
- **Enhanced hover effect** - grows to 14px on hover
- **Special highlighting** - start (green) and end (red) cities are 16px
- **Better labels** - white outline makes city names always readable

### 5. **Better City Spacing**
Reorganized city coordinates for clearer regional grouping:

**North India** (Top)
- Amritsar, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jaipur, Lucknow, Varanasi

**West India** (Left side)
- Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Pune, Goa, Indore, Bhopal

**East India** (Right side)
- Kolkata, Visakhapatnam

**Central India** (Middle)
- Nagpur

**South India** (Bottom)
- Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Kochi

### 6. **Larger Canvas**
- Increased height from 500px to 580px
- More vertical space for better city distribution
- Less cramped appearance

## 🎯 Visual Hierarchy

### Default State (No Route Selected)
```
Light gray, thin, semi-transparent routes
↓
Cities stand out with shadows and borders
↓
Clean, uncluttered map view
```

### When Hovering
```
Hovered route becomes slightly darker and thicker
↓
Distance label appears
↓
Easy to explore the graph
```

### When Route is Found
```
Selected route: Bright green, thick (6px), 100% opacity
↓
Other routes: Very light, barely visible
↓
Distance labels shown on selected route
↓
Start city: Large green circle
↓
End city: Large red circle
↓
Animated dashed line guides the eye
```

| Nodes | Blue (#4f46e5) | Green (#10b981) |
| Start Node | - | Green (#10b981, 16px) |
| End Node | - | Red (#ef4444, 16px) |
| Labels | Dark with white outline | Green with white outline |

## 💡 User Experience Improvements

### Before:
❌ All route labels always visible → cluttered  
❌ Similar line weights → hard to distinguish selected route  
❌ Crowded city placement → overlapping elements  
❌ No visual feedback on hover  

### After:
✅ Labels only show when needed → clean view  
✅ Clear visual hierarchy → selected route stands out  
✅ Better city spacing → organized by region  
✅ Interactive hover → explore routes easily  
✅ Smooth animations → pleasant to use

- Added hover states for better interactivity
- Created `.edge-weight.highlighted` for selected routes

#### 2. **visualization.js**
- Modified `drawEdge()` to hide labels by default
- Added hover event listeners for dynamic label display
- Improved label positioning with perpendicular offset
- Enhanced `highlightPath()` to show highlighted labels
- Updated `resetHighlights()` to hide all labels
- Increased default node size from 10px to 12px

#### 3. **data.js**
- Reorganized city coordinates for better spacing
- Grouped cities by geographic region
- Optimized Y-coordinates for vertical distribution
- Increased spacing between nearby cities

#### 4. **index.html**
